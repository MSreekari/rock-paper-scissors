# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a beginner-friendly Rock Paper Scissors game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

### âœ¨ Why I Built This

Everyone starts somewhere â€” I built this to strengthen my core frontend skills and get hands-on experience with:

- DOM manipulation
- JavaScript event handling
- Local storage for saving score
- Centering and aligning UI elements using Flexbox

Itâ€™s simple, but doing it myself helped me really understand how the browser works under the hood.

### ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How to structure HTML and apply styles with an external stylesheet
- Writing JavaScript logic for decision-making and randomness
- Using `localStorage` to persist data
- Debugging layout issues and understanding how `flex`, `gap`, `margin: 0 auto`, and `text-align` actually behave
